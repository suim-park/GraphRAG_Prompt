Methods to enhance the quality of measurements included holding biannual meetings of investigators, sending newsletters, and conducting random quality-assurance evaluations.\nStatistical Analysis\nA sample size of 800 patients (400 per group) was needed to achieve a statistical power of 80% to detect an absolute decrease in mortality of 10% from an existing death rate of 50% in patients who did not have a response to corticotropin (40% of the total group). All analyses were performed according to a prespecified plan. The population was analyzed according to an intention-to-treat principle. The rate of death from all causes at 28 days was analyzed with the use of Fisher's exact test for differences between study groups. A maximum overall two-sided probability of a type I error of 5% was accepted. The test result was corrected for two interim analyses for efficacy. Splitting the alpha error function was performed according to the O'Brien–Fleming method (P=0.0006, P=0.005, and P=0.047 for the first, second, and final analysis, respectively).\nThe difference in the rate of death at 28 days between the two study groups was considered to have statistical significance if the stopping criteria of the interim analysis were met or the two-sided P value of the final analysis was less than 0.047. The differences between all other secondary efficacy variables were assumed to have statistical significance for P values of less than 0.05. Kaplan–Meier curves for cumulative survival during the 28-day observation period were constructed and compared with the use of the log-rank test. The median time until the reversal of septic shock was calculated with the use of Kaplan–Meier analysis. Adverse events were reported for the per-protocol population.\nResults\nPatients\nFive hundred patients were enrolled in the study (Figure 1). One patient in the hydrocortisone group was excluded because consent was withdrawn. Of the remaining 499 patients, all met the entry criteria, although 15 also fulfilled the exclusion criteria (8 patients in the hydrocortisone group and 7 in the placebo group) since 14 had received previous corticosteroid therapy and 1 had undergone previous cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Eighty-seven percent of patients in both the hydrocortisone group and the placebo group received at least 90% of the doses of a study drug.\nFigure 1\n\nEnrollment and Outcomes.\nOf 499 patients in the study, 233 (46.7%) did not have a response to corticotropin (125 in the hydrocortisone group and 108 in the placebo group); 254 patients (50.9%) did have a response to corticotropin (118 in the hydrocortisone group and 136 in the placebo group). Results were unknown for eight patients in the hydrocortisone group and four in the placebo group (2.4%). Etomidate was used in 51 of 251 patients in the hydrocortisone group (20.3%) and in 45 of 248 patients in the placebo group (18.1%) before study entry and in 22 patients (8.8%) and 20 patients (8.1%), respectively, after study enrollment. Among the 96 patients who had received etomidate, 58 did not have a response to corticotropin (60.4%), as compared with 175 of 403 who did not receive etomidate (43.4%, P=0.004). The median time between the last dose of etomidate and enrollment was 14 hours (range, 1 to 67).\nAt baseline, the two study groups were well balanced with regard to demographic characteristics (Table 1), clinical characteristics (Table 2), and the type and site of infection and infecting organisms (Table 2 of the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 1\n\nDemographic Characteristics of the Patients, According to Subgroup.\nTable 2\n\nClinical Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline, According to Subgroup.\nPrimary End Points\nMortality\nThere was no significant difference between the two study groups in the primary outcome, the rate of death at 28 days among patients who did not have a response to corticotropin. There were 49 deaths in 125 patients in the hydrocortisone group (39.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 30.5 to 47.9) and 39 deaths in 108 patients in the placebo group (36.1%; 95% CI, 26.9 to 45.3; P=0.69). Likewise, there was no significant difference in the rate of death at 28 days in patients who had a response to corticotropin. There were 34 deaths in 118 patients in the hydrocortisone group (28.8%; 95% CI, 20.6 to 37.0) and 39 deaths among 136 patients in the placebo group (28.7%; 95% CI, 21.1 to 36.3; P=1.00). Overall, there were 86 deaths in the hydrocortisone group (34.3%; 95% CI, 28.3 to 40.2) and 78 deaths in the placebo group (\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
